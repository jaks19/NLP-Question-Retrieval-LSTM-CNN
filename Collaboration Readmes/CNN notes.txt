CNN Notes

- I took the most recent version of train_LSTM.py and modified it to work for the CNN
- This involved defining the CNN model from the paper and doing the shaping required for everything to work properly

- It seems to train slightly faster than the LSTM (though I haven't tested this)
- From what I've seen so far, the training seems to be similar to the LSTM in terms of training loss (fingers crossed)

- Also pickling after each epoch
